## Overview

For this project, we had to make a password generator using **Javascript**. There was no need to create an HTML file or a CSS file as those were provided to us. We mainly had to focus on the Javascript and **_ONLY_** the Javascript.

## How To

When the page is loaded, you will see this

From here, you would click on the "Generate Password" button and that will bring up a set of prompts to help you generate your password. The prompts will be, in order, setting the length of your password (between 8-128 characters), confirming the use of uppercase letters, confirming the use of lowercase letters, confirming the use of numbers, and then confirming the use of symbols. Once that is completed to your liking, it will generate the password in the box containing "Your Secure Password".

## Troubles/Issues

I had a rough time getting through this project. I got a majority of the code down but can't figure out certain parts of it. Mainly the big issue that I have is that once you complete all of the prompts and generate the password, it will only output _one_ character. It will still be randomized, but only one character will appear.

## Sitemap

I will be trying to continue working on this code to fix/debug the issue brought up in the previous section. Any assistance, or guidance, however will be greatly appreciated.
